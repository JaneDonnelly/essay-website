<section>
<p>In the world of design, it is often difficult to do anything that is considered innovative, revolutionary and ground-breaking. The desire to be original, one-of-a-kind and unique is pursued by many a designer and is often never achieved. Saul Bass is one of the very few that managed to achieve the theoretically unachievable. He created numerous logos for companies such as Kleenex, AT&T Corporation and Quaker Oats. Most of these logos have stood the test of time having been created in the 1960-80s and are still around today showing Bass had the skills to create timeless designs. However, it was not his branding work that thoroughly thrusted Bass into the spotlight. It was his radical work on film title sequences that gave him the name he has in the design community today. He single-handily changed how title sequences were to be viewed forever, a considerable feat for one designer. </p>

<blockquote>“In these titles I came to grips with what I think is the most challenging aspect of any creative endeavour and that is deal with ordinary things, things that we see so well that we cease to see them, deal with them in way that lets us understand them again, in a sense making the ordinary extraordinary” – Saul Bass</blockquote>

<section>
<p>Bass was a 20th Century American graphic design and Oscar-winning filmmaker. Considered by some to be the most accomplished graphic designer in history. In 1920, Bass was born in Bronx, New York City, to Eastern European Jewish immigrants. His creative abilities were evident from a young age in his love for drawing. His education began at James Monroe High School. He showed potential from the outset. In 1936, he received a fellowship to the Art Students League in Manhattan. Following which he continued to peruse his studies at Brooklyn College where he attended night classes. His tutor was Hungarian designer György Kepes, a master of Bauhaus design. In the 1940s, Bass left New York City for Los Angeles, California. He worked mostly for advertising firms in addition to designing iconic film logos and posters. In 1954, he was offered a job by filmmaker Otto Preminger to design a poster for his film Carmen Jones. It was this job offer that would set the wheels of change into motion. While working on the design for Carmen Jones, Bass states he turned to Otto and said, “why don’t we make it move?”. The rest is history. Carmen Jones was the first of many films with a title sequences designed by Saul Bass.</p>

<p>Before Bass the opening credits of a film were nothing out of the ordinary. In fact, they simply consisted of the studio logo and a sequence of title cards. Its only purpose was to inform. They were consistent, rarely changing from film to film. Bass changed all of this. He saw potential in something no one else ever had before. This is what I love about Saul Bass. He took something that was dull and uninteresting and turned it into a piece of art. Title sequence where no longer a monotonous interlude before the movie began. Bass believed audience involvement with the film should begin with the very first frame. He used his design skills to create an atmosphere for the film before it began. An example of this would be his title sequence for Psycho. His use of graphics, sound and text created an atmosphere of foreboding. He used his graphics to prepare the audience for the emotions they were going to experience. One of Bass’ first great film work, his titles and poster for Otto Preminger ‘s film “The Man with the Golden Arm “. Simplistically created with four white bars that form into an arm. The shape of the arm is jagged and disjointed which Bass want to do to portray the jarring disjointed existence of a drug addict. “Around the World in Eight Days” is another piece of impressive work by Bass. Bass opening sequence for this 1956 Oscar- winning film was the longest and most expensive ever produced at this point. It cost roughly 65,000 dollars. It is considered to be in equivalence with the movie itself. The 6-minute animated title sequences goes through the highlights of the film, introducing the cast. I enjoyed this title sequence. It was full of wit, humour and clever transitions. Not only was Bass’ work innovative, it was also incredibly well done. Bass would use this style again for “It’s a Mad Mad Mad World” for Stanley Kramer in 1963. Bass’ creativity is increasing evident through-out his title sequence career. In the opening credits of Walk on the Wild Side Bass used only cats. The opening credits consisted of the cats recreating key scenes from the move itself.</p>

<h3 <a id="an-inspiration">An Inspiration</h3> </a>
<section>
<p>Bass didn’t just help to revolutionise the film industry. His work inspired others to be more creative with their title sequences. The influence Bass has on designers even to this day shows his success in making the “ordinary, extraordinary”. Bass hadn’t created any new title work for nearly a decade. He was contacted by an admirer of his, Martin Scorsese. Scorsese was a filmmaker/actor who was commonly known in the Hollywood community. He is considered on be one of the most influential filmmakers of his time. In 1990, he asked Bass to help him work on his film Goodfellas. Which followed up with three more projects, Cape Fear, The Age of Innocence and Casino. Saul Bass was a huge influence to Scorsese. In an interview in 2011 Scorsese praised Bass highly stating, “Before I ever met him, before we worked together, he was a legend in my eyes. His designs, for film titles and company logos and record albums and posters, defined an era. In essence, they found and distilled the poetry. Of the modern, industrialised world”.</p>

<h3 <a id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> </a>
<section>
<p>Bass’ work can still be seen in the world today. Evident from the opening credits of movies such as Catch Me if You Can. The animated, story-telling style of its opening sequence is very clearly inspired by Bass. The span of his influence is quite extraordinary. In a sense he is the influence behind every title sequence.</p>
